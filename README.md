# 😪BUGS😪
## 💔BUG 01💔
-----------
```
"Stealing" a user while you are banned can show the ban screen when you exit out of a game.
For example:
steal complete -> go into game -> exit out of game -> ❗ BANNED (for previous reasons) ❗
However this isn't much of an issue as you can just re-open the app. However it is still irrating and the fix is not yet here.
```
-----------
## 💔BUG 02💔
-----------
Although not a bug but common knowledge; Developer/Moderator menu (in-match) will cease to fail (😪load infinitely) because it'll be a 403 (⚠No Permission⚠) Error.
------------
